This is the program created for the Fall 2020 Capstone Project.

EagleLife is a database program that stores contact information from members of YoungLife. It includes the following features:
* A search function to find individual users across three different subgroups, including a button to email users that opens your preferred mailing program
* A function to add new users, modify/delete existing users
* A comprehensive list of both students and leaders, both with an option to export their respective data into a .csv file
* A fully-featured set of security parameters, including a login page and pages for changing passwords (both in the case of forgetting your original password and resetting) with email confirmations for both of these
